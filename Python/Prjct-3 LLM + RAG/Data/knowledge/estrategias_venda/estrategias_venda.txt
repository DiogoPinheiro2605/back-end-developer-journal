CHUNK 1 – Customer Service Techniques

    Active Listening Before presenting any property, listen carefully to the client. Ask about lifestyle, preferences, budget, and priorities. Example: "Do you prefer an apartment in a central area or a house with a garden in the outskirts?" Benefit: Avoids offering irrelevant properties and increases the chance of closing.

    Open-ended Questions Use questions that cannot be answered with just "yes" or "no." Example: "What is most important to you in a property: location, size, or amenities?" Helps to better understand the client's real needs.

    Highlight Benefits and Differentiating Features Focus on the property's advantages instead of just talking about the price. Example: "This apartment has a spacious balcony with a view of the park, perfect for relaxing after work."

CHUNK 2 – Follow-Up Strategies

    Structured Follow-Up Initial contact → Proposal → Follow-up → Closing. Tip: Always send thank-you messages and reinforce important points discussed. Example: "It was great talking yesterday. As we discussed, this property meets your space and location needs."

    Creating Urgency Show opportunity without pressuring the client. Example: "The property received several visits this week. If you are interested, we can schedule a viewing still this week."

    Offering Alternatives If the initial property does not appeal, have similar options ready. Example: "If this apartment does not meet your expectations, I have two nearby options with similar characteristics."
