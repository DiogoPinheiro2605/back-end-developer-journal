#I want to create a calculator starting with basic logic. Instead of multiplying just two numbers, I want the user to be able to multiply as many numbers as they want. Additionally, I want to give the user the option to choose which operation they want to perform.
print("Welcome to the calculator")

while True:
    expression = input("Write your expression (or 'exit' to quit): ")
    
    if expression.lower() == "exit":
        print("SHUTTING DOWN...")
        break
    
    try:
        result = eval(expression)
        print("Result:", result)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error on the expression:", e)
